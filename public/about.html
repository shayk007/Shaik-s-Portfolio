With a background in both front-end and back-end development, I thrive in environments where I can bring designs to life and ensure seamless functionality from end to end.</p>

<p>💻 On the front-end, I specialize in crafting engaging user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React.js and Angular. I believe in creating experiences that not only look stunning but also prioritize accessibility and responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes.</p>
<p>🛠️ When it comes to the back-end, I'm proficient in building robust server-side applications using technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, and databases like MongoDB and MySQL. I enjoy architecting scalable solutions and optimizing performance to deliver blazing-fast response times.
